  abstract={Inexpensive video analysis technology now enables students to make precise measurements of an object's position at incremental times during its motion. Such capability now allows users to examine , rather than simply assume , energy conservation in a variety of situations commonly discussed in introductory physics courses. This article describes the use of video analysis software in studying energy conservation for (1) objects in freefall, (2) simple pendulums, (3) objects rolling down inclines, and (4) masses oscillating on springs.}

  abstract={Although technological innovations have the capability to significantly change how scientific investigations are done and greatly enhance the teaching and learning of science, its use is no more effective than any other resource or innovation when researched-based effective teaching practices are not followed. This paper reviews established guidelines for the effective use of technology in science and mathematics education, and presents several examples of technology products available for physics instruction and research related to their effectiveness.}
